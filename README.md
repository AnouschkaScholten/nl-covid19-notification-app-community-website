# Community website COVID-19 notificatieapp

The community website is an entry point for the community of people that are interested in learning more about the notification app and that may be willing to help out.

## About
* Slack channel for this website: [#notificatie-app-community-website](https://app.slack.com/client/T68FXPFQV/C015XMBESN4/thread/G014WUU0T19-1591803954.001400) ([join via Code for NL](https://www.codefor.nl))
* Website (beta): [View the current community website on Github.io](https://minvws.github.io/nl-covid19-notification-app-community-website/)

## Goals: 
These goals are maintained by the community manager of the Ministry of Health. Suggestions are welcome, as ever. 
* Offer the community some overview
* Improve the onboarding for new community members (also for non-techies, see below)
* Landing page for Github, Trello, Slack etc. Point out the main features of the community 
* Give props to the most active community members
* A showcase page for the openness of the project, that will hopefully inspire other government projects to be more open too
* Set the right atmosphere and expectations for people that want to help out
* Make it clear that this is partly a community driven project. Everyone is allowed to contribute, criticize, etc.

## Tartget audience 
(Potential) community members. Specifically:
* Programmers
* Designers
* Community managers
* Communication experts
Over time, we hope to engage a broader group of people, that can also help with promoting the app 

## Look and feel 
* We are building this app in collaboration with the people in NL. 
* Does not have to be super tidy, a little messyness wil lower the entry barrier.
* Friendly and welcoming
* Simple language
* Easy to use for a broad range of people, not just the die hards. Do not assume that people will know what Github, Slack, etc is. Although the die-hards are probably the biggest audience, we do not want to scare others :-). 

## To do
* Move this to do list to a Github project board
* Internationalization 
* Find a project maintainer
* User test the webpage, make modifications to make sure the website is understandable for a broader audience.
